#GTT-Client-Library

This library is a copy of a Matrix Orbital Library that I found https://github.com/MatrixOrbital/GTT-Arduino-Thermometer-Demo

This library supports the GTT25 protocol.
I modified it to fix a number of bugs.

Then I changed the byte based parser over to a paccket based parser with a callback.
